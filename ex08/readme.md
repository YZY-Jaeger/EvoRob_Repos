## EvoRobotics Group Assignment 09
Overall detailed code explanations are commented in the code.

### Team Members
- **Minsol Kim**
- **Yu Zeyuan**

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Output Motion Directions for Each Ring Cell:**
   - Implemented a method to simulate the agent's movement on a ring and output whether it moves clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) for each cell.

### Tasks/Subtasks Not Completed:
1. **Plot Best Fitness Over Generations:**
   - Attempted to implement plotting of the best fitness and population-average fitness over generations during a successful evolutionary run. Encountered challenges in formatting the fitness history array correctly, resulting in array errors.

2. **Understanding Fast Evolution Achievement:**
   - Observed rapid convergence of the evolutionary process to high fitness levels. Investigation into the underlying reasons for this accelerated convergence is ongoing.

3. **Determining Optimal Population Size:**
   - Uncertainty remains regarding the optimal size of the population for the evolutionary algorithm. Further exploration is needed to understand how population size impacts performance and convergence.
