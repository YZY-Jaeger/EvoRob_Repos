# EvoRobotics Group Assignment 08

## Team Members
- **Minsol Kim**
- **Yu Zeyuan**

## Project Files and Directory Structure
 **Task completed:**
 - **evolutionary code with deterministic(starts at bottom right) and non-deterministic(random position) starts**
 - **using bias**
 - **trajectories and fitness plots, in Plots.pdf**
 
 **Task NOT completed:**
 - **forgot to record plot and fit without using Bias**

 ## Things to improve

 - **observe and get better conclusion for influence of bias and random initialization**
  - **make simulation faster**

## Changes, influence and discussion

 - **added "mistake" variable to record robot running into walls, then "punish" with a reduction of fitness**
  - **after using random starts, the "good" ann in the last round do NOT always keep being good in current generation**
